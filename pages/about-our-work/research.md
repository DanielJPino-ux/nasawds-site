lead: The Draft U.S. Web Design Standards are an evolving set of front-end design resources. A core part of continuing to improve them is focused design research. We’re sharing our research templates, as well as documentation of our research approach and findings so far. We hope to give insights into the design choices we have made for the Standards and where <a href="https://standards.usa.gov/about-our-work/product-roadmap/">our roadmap</a> is headed. Additionally, we hope you’ll find these resources useful as you conduct research in your own work.

## Research plan template<a id="research-plan-template"></a>

### Why we built a template

We created this template so folks on our team — especially those new to research — could create a research plan quickly. We want to share this template with everyone who might find it useful; resources vary considerably among teams, and we hope to reduce the barrier that resources might present to conducting user research.

### What our research template captures

This template captures everything necessary for conducting user interviews — space to list assumptions, hypotheses, and target audience(s); a logistics checklist; day-of-interview protocol; and a template interview script. We invite you to adapt this plan and omit any sections that aren’t applicable to your research. We also [welcome your thoughts](https://github.com/18F/web-design-standards-docs/issues) on how we can make this template better.

## Our research<a id="our-research"></a>

### Field observations - June 2016

#### Where

One of our team members attended the Write/Speak/Code conference in Chicago, IL. There, they observed other conference attendees interacting with the Standards for the first time.

#### Goals

The goals of this informal research was to get a sense of how new users approach setting up the Standards — in effect, to determine how easy (or difficult) the onboarding process is.

#### Abstract

This group of new users revealed difficulty getting started with the Standards. This difficulty stemmed from unclear portions of our instructions, our use of technical terminology, and errors resulting from out-of-date development environments. Based on these findings, we updated our interview guide to focus more specifically on how we could improve our documentation. We also rewrote our Getting Started copy with an emphasis on being approachable and providing more detail.

### Listening tour findings - August 2016

#### Where

Members of the Draft U.S. Web Design Standards team conducted a weeklong listening tour (series of user interviews) in Washington, DC.

#### Goals

In speaking to teams from federal agencies that are currently using the Standards, we hoped to learn more about what drew these teams to the Standards, how they’re using the components, the process-related challenges they’re facing, and their suggestions for how we can improve our product.

#### Abstract

In general, the teams we spoke to — especially those with limited design resources — had favorable experiences using the Standards. Most of the teams would like to see “selling points” for the Standards, and many teams noted our contribution guidelines, environment-specific setup instructions, and the upgrade process as areas to improve.

### Comparative analysis - September 2016

#### Goals

The purpose of this analysis was to get a better sense of what’s currently available in terms of pattern libraries, style guides, and front-end framework documentation. By reviewing similar products, we hoped to identify opportunity areas for improving the Standards; we also hoped to uncover strategies to avoid.

#### Abstract

Our analysis suggested the website and documentation could do more to support quicker, more seamless workflow. Among other things, other libraries and frameworks seem to present their components with design that is easier to scan, code that is easier to grab, and templates that help users visualize and employ components together. The detailed recommendations from this analysis informed the work we began in fall 2016.
