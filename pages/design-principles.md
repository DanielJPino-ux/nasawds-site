    <h2>Make the best thing the easiest thing.</h2>
    <p>The NASA Web Design Standards is the easiest path for teams around NASA to comply with the latest federal policy for websites and digital services. The NASAWDS support modern web development practices, such as mobile first and responsive frameworks. By offering open-source, quick-to-download code and assets, the Standards make it easy to deliver the highest-quality NASA websites to the public.</p>

  <div class="usa-width-one-half">
    <h2>Offer accessibility out of the box.</h2>
    <p>Every asset we offer should meet the high accessibility standards outlined in Section 508. For teams that need to customize the NASAWDS to meet their needs, guidance will be offered to ensure any extensions and customizations that are made comply with Section 508 guidelines.</p>

    <h2>Design for flexibility.</h2>
    <p>Our patterns and designs are easy to adapt to support the diverse scope and needs of government digital services. The tools and components provided in the NASAWDS are focused on performance, both from a technical and team based point of view. To ensure this, everything should be validated for the user by the user. The NASAWDS wants to empower teams across NASA to make the statement “good enough for government work” means something again.</p>

    <h2>Showcase benefits for agency and users</h2>
    <p>Teams around NASA should easily be able to find inspiration from among their peers. This inspiration can jumpstart many teams own efforts but also lay the groundwork for making the business case for adopting the NASA Web Design Standards.</p>

    <h2>Reuse, reuse, reuse.</h2>
          <p>Teams should not be burdened with recreating basic components and patterns for every new product they create. The tools, patterns, and components present in the NASAWDS will be a comprehensive collection of tried-and-true assets that reflect industry best practices. This will enable teams to focus on the unique aspects of their product to ensure the general public is getting the best possible service.</p>
